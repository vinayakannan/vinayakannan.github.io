                <p class="card-text">The people of Kozhikode District are generally peaceful and less politicized compared to the neighboring Kannur District. But religious conservatism and vigilante groups are issues of concern here and unmarried couples can be questioned publicly for holding hands or walking together in a park. Marriage is the beginning of any courtship in this part of the world. In the early 2010s a restaurant in the middle of Kozhikode city was razed by a vigilante group because they had observed young college couples coming together and having coffee together regularly.
